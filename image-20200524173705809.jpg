 You may choose to enter each and every FAST with a different prep strategy and different goals. 

Your goal is to happily ESCAPE the need to find, prep, eat, and clean up food all day long. 

Hippocrates called FASTING the MOST powerful, restorative medication.

One last personal discovery I will share for your holiday travel plans.  My favorite days to FAST are travel days. You can never find anything fabulously healthy or delicious while traveling to and from destinations, through airports, unknown towns, gas stations, etc.  Fasting on the way allows you to arrive fabulously at your destination and ready to dive into some delicious local cuisine..... fasting on the way home is a great way to get back on track from a few days of over-indulgence❤️
